FORTUNE 500 QUERIES
--For this project, I used a database that has fake Fortune 500 data in it. 
I started by quering for general info, then I began to try to connect certain data like maternity leave, tenure, paid time off, to observe any patterns.

--Looking for the companies with the highest revenues
SELECT industry, ROUND(AVG(revenue), 1) as avg_revenue
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY industry
HAVING avg_revenue>=300;

--Looking for companies with generous PTO and good tenure
SELECT company_name FROM fortune_companies
WHERE paid_time_off_days >=20
AND avg_employee_tenure >=5.8;

--Organizing average employee tenure by industry
SELECT industry, ROUND(AVG(avg_employee_tenure),1) FROM fortune_companies 
GROUP BY industry;

SELECT industry, avg_employee_tenure FROM fortune_companies 
GROUP BY industry;

SELECT avg_employee_tenure FROM fortune_companies;

--Looking for the best maternity leave offered by sorting from "Best" to "Poor"
SELECT maternity_leave_weeks, company_name,
CASE WHEN maternity_leave_weeks>=12 THEN 'Best'
WHEN maternity_leave_weeks>=8 THEN 'Ok'
ELSE 'Poor'
END AS maternity_leave_rank
FROM fortune_companies
ORDER BY maternity_leave_rank;
